    <td width="469">General Audience. All ages admitted. This signifies that the 
      film rated contains nothing most parents will consider offensive for even 
      their youngest children to see or hear. Nudity, sex scenes, and scenes of 
      drug use are absent; violence is minimal; snippets of dialogue may go beyond 
      polite conversation but do not go beyond common everyday expressions. </td>

    <td><div align="center"><img src="images/PG(small)-01.gif" width="250" height="51"></div></td>
    <td>Parental Guidance Suggested. Some material may not be suitable for children. 
      This signifies that the film rated may contain some material parents might 
      not like to expose to their young children - material that will clearly 
      need to be examined or inquired about before children are allowed to attend 
      the film. Explicit sex scenes and scenes of drug use are absent; nudity, 
      if present, is seen only briefly, horror and violence do not exceed moderate 
      levels.</td>

    <td>Parents Strongly Cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children 
      under 13. This signifies that the film rated may be inappropriate for pre-teens. 
      Parents should be especially careful about letting their younger children 
      attend. Rough or persistent violence is absent; sexually-oriented nudity 
      is generally absent; some scenes of drug use may be seen; one use of the 
      harsher sexually derived words may be heard.</td>

    <td>Restricted-Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian (age 
      varies in some locations). This signifies that the rating board has concluded 
      that the film rated contains some adult material. Parents are urged to learn 
      more about the film before taking their children to see it. An R may be 
      assigned due to, among other things, a film's use of language, theme, violence, 
      sex or its portrayal of drug use.</td>

  <tr> 
    <td><div align="center"><img src="images/NC-17(small)-01.gif" width="250" height="54"></div></td>
    <td>No One 17 and Under Admitted. This signifies that the rating board believes 
      that most American parents would feel that the film is patently adult and 
      that children age 17 and under should not be admitted to it. The film may 
      contain explicit sex scenes, an accumulation of sexually-oriented language, 
      or scenes of excessive violence. The NC-17 designation does not, however, 
      signify that the rated film is obscene or pornographic.</td>
